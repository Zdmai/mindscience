# 1D Burgers

## Overview

Burgers' equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that simulates the propagation and reflection of shock waves. It is widely used in the fields of fluid mechanics, nonlinear acoustics, gas dynamics et al. It is named after Johannes Martins Hamburg (1895-1981). In this case, MindFlow fluid simulation suite is used to solve the Burgers' equation in one-dimensional viscous state based on the physical-driven PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks) method.
